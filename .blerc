# to $HISTFILE every time a command is executed.

# This option specifies the cursor position after the move between the
# history entries. If a non-empty value is specified, ble.sh tries to
# preserve the position. When the string after the move is shorter
# than the original position, the cursor position is moved to the end
# of text. If the value is empty, the cursor position is moved to the
# end of text when it moved to the older history entry, or the
# beginning of text when it moved to the recent history entry.
bleopt history_preserve_point=1

# This option controls the target range in the command history for
# erasedups, which is performed when it is specified in
# HISTCONTROL. When this option has an empty value, the target range
# is the entire history as in the plain Bash. When this option
# evaluates to a positive integer count, the target range is the last
# count entries in the command history. When this option evaluates to
# a non-positive integer offset, offset specifies the beginning of the
# target range relative to the history count at the session start. The
# end of the target range is always the end of the command history.
