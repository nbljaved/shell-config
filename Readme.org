My shell setup

- Install [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]]

- To link the files to your home folder
  (Before creating a soft-link, you will have to remove the file existing at that location, probably save them somewhere else.)
  #+begin_src shell
  ln -s ~/shell-config/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
  ln -s ~/shell-config/kitty   ~/.config/
  ln -s ~/shell-config/.blerc  ~/.blerc
  #+end_src
